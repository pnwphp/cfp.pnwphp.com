    <h2 class="headline--beta">{{ site.title }} Speaker Information</h2>
    <p>
        We're committed to bringing together some of the best speakers from all around the
        world to share their knowledge with you here. We provide a travel and
        accommodation package to all selected speakers to help make this possible.
    </p>
    <h3 class="headline--alpha">About the event</h3>
    <p>
        Speakers will be provided with a projector, a wireless lapel microphone and a screen
        for their presentation (size depends on the room). Speakers should bring any equipment
        they need to connect to projectors (VGA). It is also suggested that you reduce your
        dependency on the in-house internet connection as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the Call for Papers closes, the organizers will sort through the submissions, making
        their selections. Speakers will be notified as soon as the selection process has been completed.
    </p>

    <p>
       We <strong>strongly</strong> encourage potential speakers to submit 3 or more
       submissions on more than one topic. The more submissions you contribute, the
      more options you give us to pick you.
    </p>
    <p>
       Write <em>1-2</em> paragraphs to describe what your talk is about. Be sure your
       talk title and abstract define the exact topic you want to talk about and what
       you hope people will learn from the session.
